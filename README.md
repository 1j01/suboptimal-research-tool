"Research" topics automatically â€” <img alt="powered by Google" src="https://maps.gstatic.com/mapfiles/api-3/images/powered-by-google-on-white2.png" align="center">'s autocomplete.

(This is the *wrong way* to use Google for research, FYI.)

### Installation

### Module Usage

If you have some use for this, here it is!

```js
var research = require("suboptimal-research-tool");
research("bats", function(err, subject){
	if(err){
		return console.error(err);
	}
	console.log(
		subject.singular, // "bat"
		subject.plural, // "bats"
		subject.adjectives, // ["scary", etc.]
		subject.verbs // ["hibernate", etc.]
	);
});
```

### About

This module asks [Google's autocomplete team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blB_X38YSxQ) what people search for in relation to a given subject.
Specifially, it finds what people have asked in the form of `Why are <SUBJECTs>...?` (hoping for adjectives) and `Why do <SUBJECTs>...?` (hoping for verb phrases).

Because of the way the results are procured, they are prone to include misconceptions, stereotypes and opinions.

For instance, people search for "why are zebras extinct", so this module blindly assumes zebras are extinct.
